Dare I say I finally fixed it!  In <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">/Library/Preferences</span>, I removed <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">com.apple.windowserver.plist</span>, restarted ARD, and all was good!  I logged in and out through Apple Remote Desktop a few times to verify the bug was gone, and it was. <div>

  I&#8217;m not sure if it was a combination of a .plist file in my home directory as well as the one above.
