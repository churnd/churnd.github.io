> Vista today, post-Service Pack 2, which is now in the marketplace, is the safest, most reliable OS we&#8217;ve ever built. It&#8217;s also the most secure OS on the planet, including Linux and open source and Apple Leopard. It&#8217;s the safest and most secure OS on the planet today.

I really, really, really, really hate crap like this for two reasons:

1.  It&#8217;s an outright lie to improve sales.
2.  It makes my job harder.

The first reason doesn&#8217;t bother me so much.  I can live with marketing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt" target="_blank">FUD</a>.  The second, however, bothers me quite a bit.  It puts the burden on me, an IT professional who has to support actual end users on a daily basis, to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that Windows IS NOT more secure than Linux or OS X.  In an academic/research environment, the person who is more credentialed is believed first.  So in this case, I&#8217;m up against a Microsoft CIO.  I can see the future conversation now:

*   Them &#8211; &#8220;Hey, I read Windows is more secure than Linux or OS X&#8221;
*   Me &#8211; &#8220;That&#8217;s a lie to improve sales on Microsoft&#8217;s end&#8221;
*   Them &#8211; &#8220;But the guy who said it was Microsoft&#8217;s Chief Information Officer.  He must know what he&#8217;s talking about&#8221;
*   Me &#8211; &#8220;You would think so, but he&#8217;s putting his company&#8217;s interest over his customers&#8217;.  It&#8217;s a lie to improve sales.&#8221;
*   Them &#8211; &#8220;Are you saying you&#8217;re smarter than a Microsoft CIO?&#8221;
*   Me &#8211; &#8220;No, I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s a lie.  Windows is not more secure than OS X or Linux.&#8221;
*   Them &#8211; &#8220;You expect me to believe you over a CIO?&#8221;
*   Me &#8211; &#8220;In this case, yes.&#8221;

Then I go on to have to explain myself and cite references of proof, in which they will lose interest 5 minutes into my explanation.

So, because of a careless statement by someone who ***should*** know better, it&#8217;s effectively made my life harder.  Thanks Kevin!
