I'm really liking [OpenSolaris](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/).  I've always wanted to get into Sun more, and OpenSolaris seems to ease the transition from Linux.  Being a file server admin, I want to explore ZFS more.  I can't wait until it's officially part of Mac OS X.

I have it up and running in [VMware Fusion](http://blogs.sun.com/souvik/entry/getting_started_with_opensolaris_2008), and have been using it since July (I think svn_96).  If you follow that link, make sure you check the comments for other tips on getting it working in Fusion 2.0.

With the past releases, I'd been having trouble doing updates.  I'm not sure if it was my fault, or just some bugs that needed fixing.  Probably both.  :)  It was actually probably a good thing, because I learned a lot about using **beadm** that I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise.  That said, I was very impressed this morning when I did the latest **pkg image-update** and it went off without a hitch!  It seems that with the progress the OpenSolaris team is making, it won't be long before it's just as popular, if not more, than your favorite Linux distro.
