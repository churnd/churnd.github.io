My experiences with Vista so far have been&#8230; eh. Every day I contemplate going back to XP, but I always talk myself out of it. Getting some programs to work right is a hassle, and some just don&#8217;t work right at all no matter what I try. Most software vendors&#8217; solution to the issue doesn&#8217;t sit well with me at all: buy the newer version. So why do I use Vista? Curiosity, and I&#8217;ll likely have to support it one day.

I&#8217;m getting a bigger boot drive soon, though. I&#8217;m going to triple boot XP/Vista, Ubuntu x64, and Solaris 10. I still haven&#8217;t decided whether or not to go back to XP. I might quad-boot, but that 150GB Raptor will run out of space pretty quick if I do that.
