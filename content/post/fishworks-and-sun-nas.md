Just thought I&#8217;d post a quick blurb on all the great work Sun is doing in the NAS world.  OpenSolaris is really taking off as an OS of choice with sysadmins, not just for ZFS&#8217;s awesome capabilities, but also that it makes a great web/app/dbms server platform.

Being a file server admin myself, I can&#8217;t help but not want to deploy one of these babies:  <a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/index.jsp" target="_blank">Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage Systems &#8211; Amber Road Overview</a>.  Simple, yet powerful, this sucker runs circles around my aging Windows and Mac OS file servers.

Another thing I love about it is it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/features.jsp" target="_blank">Status Dashboard</a>, which you can download and run in a VM.  I&#8217;m trying it out now, and it&#8217;s just amazing. This blog by <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/entry/status_dashboard" target="_blank">Brendan Gregg</a>, Fishworks engineer, shows some of it&#8217;s features in more detail.

Maybe I can work it into the next fiscal year&#8217;s budget. Ha&#8230; in my dreams. <img src='http://churnd.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
