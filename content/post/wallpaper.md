I have something of a wallpaper fetish.  I can&#8217;t stand bad wallpaper (too busy, colorful, etc).  IMO, wallpaper should not distract the user.  I use a Macbook Pro, so this has been my wallpaper for the past few years and I still haven&#8217;t grown tired of it.  I think that&#8217;s a record for me.
