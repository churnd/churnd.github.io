Google Reader has always been my primary feed reader for both my Mac and iPhone.  The functionality I get from it, in my opinion, rivals anything else.  I can star a feed from my iPhone to follow up with later on my Mac.  This is particularly useful for software or tips I want to try.  I&#8217;ve just recently gotten into Twitter and Friendfeed, as well as sharing items with notes via Google Reader.  I&#8217;ve configured Friendfeed to import those, which in turn make it&#8217;s way to Twitter.  Being able to integrate all of those services is awesome.

So what made me want to try NetNewsWire?  I like native applications a little better than web apps, even web apps as good as Google Reader.  I think the user experience is still better for a native app than one that runs out of your browser.  There&#8217;s more customization and sorting options and the UI is cleaner and more robust.  I can also read feeds if I&#8217;m ever offline (which is usually never anyway).  Both Mac and iPhone apps can also sync to NewsGator, which makes it easy to stay up to date.

Again, I can&#8217;t stand to criticize free software negatively.  I&#8217;m very grateful both NetNewsWire for the Mac and iPhone are free apps.

Things I don&#8217;t like about NetNewsWire:

1.  Most feeds require going to a browser anyway.  NetNewsWire has one &#8220;built-in&#8221;, but the window is almost always never big enough.  I still prefer a full browser window.
2.  The iPhone app takes a while to update, especially if you haven&#8217;t used it recently.  I don&#8217;t have the patience for it.
3.  The iPhone app doesn&#8217;t allow you to read &#8220;all&#8221;, just one category at a time.
4.  Almost no integration with other social networking sites.

Things I don&#8217;t like about Google Reader:

1.  It runs in a browser.  Eh.  Sometimes that can be distracting.
2.  The iPhone interface will sometimes &#8220;reset&#8221; itself.  Very frustrating to lose your place.  It&#8217;s like trying to read a book with no bookmark.
3.  I have a slight suspicion I&#8217;m missing feeds.  This morning I saw a feed in NetNewsWire that didn&#8217;t show up in Google Reader.  Unless I looked at the wrong feed (which I don&#8217;t think I did), that sucks&#8230; the feed I missed was a good one too.

I&#8217;ve heard rumors that NetNewsWire <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/feeddemon-to-sync-with-google-reader.html" target="_blank">might be able to sync</a> with Google Reader in the future.  This would be great, but I would need more than just read/unread status to make the switch fully.  For now, I&#8217;ll stick with Google Reader.

\*\*UPDATE\*\*  
The &#8220;missing feed&#8221; in #3 above just showed up in Google Reader. Seems there&#8217;s a noticeable delay. At least it&#8217;s not missing altogether. <img src='http://churnd.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
