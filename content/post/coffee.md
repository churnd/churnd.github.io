I&#8217;ve decided I will only drink coffee in mornings I absolutely need it. This is usually just during the weekdays when I have to wake up at 5:30am. On the weekends, I get up whenever I wake up&#8230; usually at 8am or so. It was starting to turn into a habit, where I would fix a few cups every morning whether I was tired or not. I decided not to let it for two reasons:

1.  You build up a tolerance to caffeine, and I don&#8217;t want to.  I like the boost!  I don&#8217;t want to get dependent on it.
2.  Too much caffeine when I&#8217;m not tired is a bad thing.  I get jittery and sometimes headaches.

What&#8217;s ironic is, up until a few years ago, I was not a regular coffee drinker.  I would look at other drinkers and make fun of how they &#8220;had to have their regular fix&#8221;, and promised myself I wouldn&#8217;t turn into that.  I was on the track to turning into that, and I&#8217;m glad I caught it in time.  Caffeine is addictive&#8230; use in moderation!
