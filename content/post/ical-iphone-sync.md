Seems like Google Calendar is not without it&#8217;s flaws either on the iPhone.  I&#8217;m syncing the calendar from iCal.  The calendar shows up on my iPhone as read-only, so I can&#8217;t add any appointments.  I thought I&#8217;d be able to do this &#8220;offline&#8221;, and have it sync to iCal, then upload to Google Calendar.  No dice.  Ideally, I&#8217;d be able to do CalDAV straight from the iPhone.  [John Gruber&#8217;s thoughts][1] mirror my own, though I am able to get alarms on my iPhone if I go &#8220;iCal &#8211;> iPhone&#8221; sync. <div>

  The iPhone only does direct sync from MobileMe, but MobileMe doesn&#8217;t allow calendar sharing between MobileMe users like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/googlecalendar/overview.html">Google does</a>.

  Maybe the solution is to use a combination of MobileMe, Google Calendar, and <a href="http://www.busymac.com/">BusySync</a>, and take CalDAV out of the picture for now.  Like so:

  I think that would solve all of the problems, except for me being a cheap bastard and not wanting to pony up the dough.  :)  I also have a gut feeling that somebody is going to come up with a way to sync the iPhone with Google Calendar sooner or later.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.
