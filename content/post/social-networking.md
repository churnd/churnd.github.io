Now that I&#8217;ve finally made the effort to integrate my social networking workflow (I know, what took so long??), I decided to leave Facebook out of it. My reasons for this are simple. I consider Facebook to be a more personal, keep in touch with your friends and family kinda place. I don&#8217;t add people as friends if I don&#8217;t know them.

Most of my friends and family don&#8217;t fall into the technical world (I hate that term, but can&#8217;t think of a better one). So, I consider my Twitter, Friendfeed, Google Reader, blog, etc&#8230; basically anything but Facebook, to be more technical. I don&#8217;t know most of the people I follow on any of these services, but I find myself relating to a lot of them and I can see it being a great way to make a little noise in that technical world. I don&#8217;t think my Facebook friends would appreciate all that technical noise anyway. <img src='http://churnd.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> I know most A-list bloggers will tell you full integration is the way to go. I&#8217;ll think a little different this time around.
