A few weeks ago, I saw that <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a> was offering a free two week trial for it&#8217;s hosting services.  Creating my own website has been something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for quite a while now.  I thought it would be a good idea to pull everything I do all under one domain.  So ideally I&#8217;d like my site to host my blog, pictures/movies, etc, etc, so I thought the free trial would be a good way to test this out.  I quickly realized it&#8217;s probably not such a great idea.

I&#8217;m not a web developer.  It&#8217;s a hobby of mine that I am not very good at.  So I thought, can I provide a better photo experience than Flickr, or a better movie experience than YouTube?  Probably not.  So, I&#8217;d have to integrate those services.  While doable, at best it would serve to be a proxy to all of my other hosted-for-free services.  I guess that would make it easier for people to keep track of everything.  Hmm&#8230; I didn&#8217;t think about that until I just typed it.  My fingers are smarter than I am.  :)
