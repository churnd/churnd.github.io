Yet again I&#8217;m having IMAP problems with our Groupwise 7 server and my Mail.app client. My Sent Items folder refuses to sync. I&#8217;ve even completely reset Mail.app, and I still have the problem. What&#8217;s confusing me is I don&#8217;t have the problem with any other client such as my iPhone&#8217;s Mail.app or Thunderbird on my Mac.

It seems that Mail.app is stuck in &#8220;synchronize&#8221; mode. So, first I quit Mail.app. Using the Groupwise for Mac, I moved all of my Sent Items out of my Sent Items folder into a different folder (I used Cabinet), then quit Groupwise for Mac. I re-opened Mail.app and saw all of the emails in the Cabinet IMAP folder. From there, I dragged them into the Sent (Sent Items) folder, and all seems to be ok again.

Until next time!&#8230;
