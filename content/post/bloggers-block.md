I can distinctly remember driving to work yesterday and coming up with two topics that I really wanted to blog about. Then I get to work and the days events catch me in their whirlwind. It seems that pretty much the only time I have to blog is the morning before work.

So here I am sitting with my coffee, ready to blog&#8230; but for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember what I wanted to blog about. I&#8217;ll probably start making a note of these topics so I can get back to them later. That could get to be a pretty long list&#8230;
