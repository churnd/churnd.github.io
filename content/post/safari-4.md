I&#8217;ve made <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari 4 Beta</a> my primary browser. The new features are awesome and I love them all! If I had to choose my favorite, I&#8217;d pick the Nitro JS engine. It&#8217;s so much faster than anything else I&#8217;ve used. All of the new features are listed <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

The bad thing is, most of my old Safari add-ons no longer work. The good thing is, I don&#8217;t need &#8216;em. <img src='http://churnd.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> The search bar has auto-suggest which replaces <a href="http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/index_en.php" target="_blank">Inquisitor</a>. The only other feature I really missed was being able to open all links in a tab in the current window. Turns out that&#8217;s an easy fix. From the Terminal, copy and paste this code:

`defaults write com.apple.Safari TargetedClicksCreateTabs -bool true`

To go back the other way, just change **true** at the end to **false**.

Happy Surfing!
