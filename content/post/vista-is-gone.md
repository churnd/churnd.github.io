Friday I got home from work, popped DBAN in my desktop PC, and wiped out my primary OS hard drive, in which my primary OS was Windows Vista. It felt good.

I&#8217;ve been running Vista as my primary OS since January. It has been nothing but a headache. Several times I&#8217;ve contemplated removing it and re-installing XP. I talked myself out of it. &#8220;Give it time&#8230; it&#8217;s a new OS&#8221;, I kept reassuring myself.

Everything was slower. Why? Nice (but useless) visual effects? I enjoyed the new theme at first, and I guess I convinced myself it was worth the sacrifice in speed. As time went on, the newness wore off, and I found myself growing increasingly irritated with waiting at least twice as long for an application to open. As well as having a few of my XP compatible applications not work.

My desktop PC is decent: 
*   AMD Athlon X2 4400 Toledo
*   Asus A8N-SLI Delux Motherboard
*   2GB Corsair XMS DDR 400 SDRAM
*   EVGA GeForce 7600GT 128MB GDDR3
*   WD 160GB 10K RPM Raptor (Main OS HD)
*   Other goodies that don&#8217;t affect performance.

The Vista Performance Rating tool gave it a 5. It sure didn&#8217;t feel like a 5. I gave SuperFetch plenty of time to &#8220;get to know me&#8221;. I saw some improvement in how applications launched over time, but I still wasn&#8217;t impressed.

I think the straw that finally broke the camels back came when I read of the improvements that would come with SP1. First, how can you work on an OS for 5 years, then come out with a Service Pack a year after it&#8217;s release? That&#8217;s a marketing scheme if I ever saw one. Everyone knows what a Service Pack is, and how they supposedly make everything better. True, SP2 for XP did make things better. I think Microsoft is playing that angle a little too hard.

Anyway, I downloaded the &#8220;speed fixes&#8221; that were supposed to come with SP1 for Vista: 
1.  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=938979" target="_blank">Performance Update</a>
2.  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=938194" target="_blank">Compatibility Update</a>

I installed both and tried them out for 2 months. I was impressed some at first, but again it wore off.

Now that I have XP installed with all major updates, and have the same functionality as Vista with Google Desktop and Picasa, I know I will never go back to Vista again. I have a triple boot of XP, Ubuntu, and openSuSE 10.2 x64 up and running now. The next computer I buy will be a Mac.
