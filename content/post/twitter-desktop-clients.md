I&#8217;ve been trying out Twitter desktop clients for OS X, such as [Twitterific][1], [Twhirl][2], and [Tweetdeck][3]. First off, I just wanna say all 3 clients are awesome. For some reason I can&#8217;t stand to criticize what people give away for free.

I think I just don&#8217;t like Adobe AIR applications. One of the things I like the most about OS X is it&#8217;s user experience provided by it&#8217;s UI. Applications all look like they belong together, and work with one another. AIR applications don&#8217;t fall into that category. It&#8217;s more like a flash application for your desktop. It&#8217;s a good idea, and I can appreciate it for it&#8217;s cross-platform compatibility, kinda like Java. I&#8217;m sure developers love it but from a user standpoint, it&#8217;s no more fun to use than a Java app.

That being said, Twitterific is my favorite by far. It&#8217;s not as fully featured as Twhirl, but the UI is much more pleasant to use. I like that I can have an icon on the menu bar up out of the way. I get updates via Growl notifications and the icon turns blue, so then I can click on the icon to read the updates. The actual window is transparent and up out of the way. I use the free version and don&#8217;t mind the ads at all. I just wish it had the bit.ly URL shortening and some kind of picture uploading, along with location awareness. Something I really like doing is checking out what&#8217;s going on in the Twittersphere within a 5 mile radius or so. Living in Cincinnati, there&#8217;s usually a lot! It makes for some fun reading, and I think it&#8217;s a great way to network.
