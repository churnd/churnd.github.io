I am deaf as a doornail, and have been since 3rd grade&#8230; 8 years old I think?  I&#8217;ve always sucked at figuring out my age during life events.  Anyway, I&#8217;m really happy to see that a lot of online video websites such as YouTube and Hulu are making an effort to support closed captioning.  Now, if I&#8217;m lucky enough, I can finally watch some videos and understand what they&#8217;re saying.  A good example is the Weekly Address from President-Elect Obama:

<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span> 
If a president has done this before, I&#8217;ve never seen it.  Thank you, Obama!

Hulu.com also has a list of recent TV shows such as The Office, with closed captioning included.  Now if I&#8217;ve missed a show I can watch it whenever I get a chance.

There&#8217;s a lot of controversy surrounding closed captioning.  As in, why hasn&#8217;t it changed to keep up with the times?  Why doesn&#8217;t it look better?  Why did it take so long for YouTube to add that feature?  It seems that it takes several years for accessibility to catch up with technology.  It shouldn&#8217;t be that way, but I don&#8217;t know enough about the process to offer a better alternative.  Maybe I should read up.
