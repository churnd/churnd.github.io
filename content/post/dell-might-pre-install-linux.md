I&#8217;m excited, but then again I&#8217;m not. Why? A few reasons: 
1.  In order this endeavor to be successful, the Linux machines will have to be cheaper than Windows. That likely won&#8217;t happen. Microsoft will make sure of it.
2.  The average everyday Joe isn&#8217;t ready for Linux. He will likely get frustrated too easily because he can&#8217;t install that Quicken .<span class="blsp-spelling-error">exe</span> he bought for Windows last year, and either return it or demand a refund.
3.  Linux isn&#8217;t ready for Joe either. Commercial apps are lacking, and the open source versions aren&#8217;t quite ready to fully replace their commercial counterparts. Gimp cannot trump <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Photoshop</span> yet.

Linux is still a hobbyists OS. It&#8217;s not ready to replace every Windows PC in every home just yet. Until it is, maybe Dell should hold off. At least for <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Linux&#8217;</span> sake.
