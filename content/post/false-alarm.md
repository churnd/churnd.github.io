So last night was our first night in our home that is now protected by a security system.  It was also our first false-alarm.  I&#8217;m sure everybody does that, right?  I&#8217;m still not sure how it went off, but the cops came and were seemingly understanding about the whole thing.  Hopefully no hard feelings.  Something that kinda piqued my curiosity is, the cops didn&#8217;t ask me who I was.  I guess they just assumed because I answered the front door in my pajamas that I lived there.  I can see that being a pretty safe assumption, but I still would have liked them to ask questions only I would&#8217;ve known.  I&#8217;ll probably call the security company and find out more about this.

Note to burglars, pajamas are good camouflage!
