No, not the coffee.  :)  <a title="Espresso" href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a> is one of the popular web development IDE's for OS X.  I've been jumping back and forth between using Espresso, <a  title="Coda (web development software)" href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" rel="homepage">Coda</a>, & <a  title="Transmit (FTP client)" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/" rel="homepage">Transmit</a> + <a  title="TextMate" href="http://www.macromates.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Textmate</a>.  Lately I've been using Espresso, especially since I've found tons of great themes & sugars to help extend it's functionality.  There is a very active Espresso community on <a  title="GitHub" href="http://github.com" rel="homepage">GitHub</a>, and <a href="http://fileability.net/coffee/" target="_blank">this website</a> contains a great collection.

My requirements for a good web development IDE:

1.  Syntax highlighting.  Makes reading code much easier.  I prefer dark backgrounds over white/colored text.
2.  Code folding.  I don't use this heavily, but when I need it, I **need** it.  I will switch to a different editor if I have to.
3.  Css Navigators.  These are so useful when going through CSS stylesheets so you can actually see what style you're editing:

The nice thing about getting these sugars & themes from GitHub is that updates are easy.  Just "cd" to where the sugar or theme lives & do "git pull".  It would be nice if I could figure out a way to just do one "master pull", but based on the Coffee House website, it sounds like MacRabbit is working on a way of <a href="http://fileability.net/coffee/sugar/Sugar%20Manager" target="_blank">making this better</a>.

So, I definitely underestimated Espresso the first few times I tried it.  Now that I can easily extend it's functionality, it's earned a permanent place in my dock as my primary web development IDE.
