I broke down and bought a family pack of MobileMe for the wife and I from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB825Z-A-MobileMe-Family/dp/B001BY0C2U/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=software&qid=1228359746&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Amazon</a> for $85.  A few things prompted my decision:

1.  **Price** &#8211; that&#8217;s a killer deal!
2.  **Calendar Sync** &#8211; no other service I&#8217;ve seen yet will sync directly *from* the iPhone wirelessly*
3.  **Gallery** &#8211; this is one of the better looking online photo galleries I&#8217;ve seen.
4.  **iWeb** &#8211; I think once I show the wife how easy this is to use, she&#8217;ll love it.
5.  **Backup** &#8211; nice having the peace of mind that my critical stuff is backed up daily to iDisk for off-site storage.  Good compliment to Time Machine.

I haven&#8217;t abandoned Google&#8217;s services at all.  In fact, I&#8217;m working on keeping them all synced.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to use my @me.com email address to replace my gmail.com address just yet.  Most likely I&#8217;ll use it as a secondary account.

One thing I&#8217;m really waiting on, and I&#8217;ve submitted a feature request to the MobileMe team a few times, is the ability to sync subscribed calendars with the full push functionality available with the personal calendars.

*I know about <a href="http://www.nuevasync.com/" target="_blank">Nuevasync</a>.  I don&#8217;t like the idea of giving them my Google login.  Plus, it&#8217;s in beta.  Some people have said it went down on them and their calendars disappeared during that time.  My wife would not like that very much at all.
