I&#8217;m not looking forward to going to work today and being exposed to all of the political banter surrounding the passage of the new Health Care Reform Plan.

I know a lot of smart people who are for the plan, and I know a lot of smart people who are against it.  I am not a smart person, but this tells me there will be both good and bad things coming.  I stay optimistic because bad things can be fixed, everybody likes good things, and I&#8217;m glad something is finally being done.  All I can do is hope history doesn&#8217;t repeat itself, and Washington doesn&#8217;t let this plan fall behind the scenes like they&#8217;ve done in the past.  I personally think that&#8217;s the only reason why a lot of these good ideas failed, is because they were neglected.

Only negative thought I have is, I can already see insurance companies spending time and resources to find loopholes in the plan to capitalize on.  I&#8217;m sure there are some, because no plan is perfect.  They say they&#8217;re concerned about the money being spent, but what this really means is that they&#8217;re concerned about the money they stand to lose.  After all, business is business, right?

I look forward to the day healthcare becomes what it should be, a service to the people&#8230; not a business to capitalize on.  Maybe I&#8217;m just idealistic&#8230; I prefer to say optimistic.
