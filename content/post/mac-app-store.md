The Mac App Store was released today.  I loved it&#8230; for about 30 mins, then the newness of it wore off.  I then realized, I&#8217;ll probably never use it to buy an app if I can help it.  It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like it, I do&#8230; it&#8217;s just that it tries to hold my hand a bit too much.  I can see grandma using it happily & not having to worry about dealing with software activation & finding the right app for this or that.  But for me&#8230; a geek&#8230; I don&#8217;t need or want that kind of control over my computer.

This <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5726764/why-the-mac-app-store-sucks" target="_blank">article by Lifehacker</a> pretty much sums up exactly how I feel.  Before I read the article, I was compiling my own list of &#8220;don&#8217;t likes&#8221; in my head, and they wound up pretty similar to the article:

1.  No trials &#8211; this is just dumb for more expensive software.  I&#8217;m not going to pay $50 for an app without being able to try it out first.
2.  No beta testing &#8211; I do this frequently with apps like Firefox and 1Password.  Big no-no IMO.
3.  Everything installed in /Applications &#8211; Usually this is fine, but I like to tweak a little.  For example, I have a lot of &#8220;social&#8221; apps installed, so I have them in /Applications/Social/ (along with it&#8217;s own custom icon).  The App Store wouldn&#8217;t like this.
4.  A lot of my favorite apps, such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Bjango" href="http://bjango.com/" rel="homepage">Bjango</a>&#8216;s <a class="zem_slink" title="iStat Menus" href="http://islayer.com/apps/istatmenus/" rel="homepage">iStat Menus</a>, don&#8217;t qualify for the App Store because it delves too deeply into <a class="zem_slink" title="Mac OS X" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" rel="homepage">OS X</a>&#8216;s internals & <a class="zem_slink" title="Apple" href="http://www.apple.com" rel="homepage">Apple</a> doesn&#8217;t like that.

It&#8217;s no secret Apple created the Mac App Store primarily because of the <a class="zem_slink" title="IOS (Apple)" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage">iOS</a> App Store&#8217;s huge success.  I don&#8217;t think the Mac App Store will be as successful, because they are two entirely different platforms.  Even with OS X 10.7 Lion, which is trying to make the Mac more iOS-like, people will always want to use a computer to do a lot more than what an iOS device can do.  The iOS App Store is so successful because there&#8217;s only so many things you can do on an iOS device.  While you can do a lot of the same everyday tasks on iOS, it is not a replacement for a fully functional computer.  Dare I say it will probably never be.  The iOS&#8217;s closed ecosystem works because people know &#8220;If I can&#8217;t do it on iOS, I have a computer that can&#8221;.

Another thought I had was &#8220;I wonder if Apple will move iOS devices out of iTunes & start managing them via the Mac App Store.&#8221;  Then I realized, each iOS device is also an iPod which plays media bought from iTunes, so that&#8217;s unlikely.

On the plus side, Apple hasn&#8217;t restricted OS X to only the Mac App Store.  You can still download & install your own programs manually just like before.  It will be interested to see if Apple starts to move towards a more closed ecosystem like the iOS with OS X in the coming years.  I really can&#8217;t see it happening, but who knows.
