Up until this point, I had been using several Safari Add-ons to bring functionality that I missed using Firefox.  Such as, undo closing a tab, always open in a tab, remember last session, etc.  I had been using <a href="http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/forgetmenot" target="_blank">ForgetMeNot</a> and <a href="http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html" target="_blank">Safari Stand</a> through <a href="http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php" target="_blank">SIMBL</a>, which worked but I think ForgetMeNot made Safari a slight bit more unstable.  I&#8217;m also too cheap to use anything that I&#8217;d have to pay for, such as <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/index.html" target="_blank">Saft</a>.

I was happy to find there&#8217;s now a single add-on that would do everything I wanted, and more:  <a href="http://www.machangout.com/" target="_blank">Glims</a>.  Yes, it&#8217;s in beta, but I&#8217;ve been using it for the past week with no problems, and I&#8217;ll keep using it as long as it&#8217;s free!  :)
