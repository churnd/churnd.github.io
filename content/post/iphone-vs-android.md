Now that Android phones are gaining momentum in the mobile marketplace, people are starting to get a better idea of what it would be like to have a truly &#8220;open&#8221; phone OS.  The results are <a href="http://nanocr.eu/2010/06/27/googles-mismanagement-of-the-android-market/" target="_blank">not always proving favorable</a>.

It&#8217;s like the saying goes, with freedom comes responsibility.  Do you trust all Android app developers to be responsible with your information?  To create a stable app?  To not break the law?  Why should you, the user, have to worry about all of that?  I know I don&#8217;t want to have to dig into reviews of every app I install just to make sure it won&#8217;t crash my phone or steal my data.  Are you OK with Google having <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/firewall/2010/06/25/google-flips-kill-switch-deletes-and-downplays-botnet-demo-android-apps/" target="_self">complete access to your phone anytime they want it</a>?

Flash on a phone?  You can have it, I don&#8217;t want it.  I&#8217;d like my phone to last more than 30 mins on one charge, and not crash my browser almost every time I want to watch a video.  Apple found a <a href="http://www.apple.com/html5/" target="_blank">better way</a> to deliver mobile video content.  Sorry Adobe.

Apple&#8217;s App Store takes all of that burden off of your shoulders, with some pitfalls.  No, you can&#8217;t have any app you want.  Yes, sometimes Apple&#8217;s a bit trigger happy in killing App Store submissions.  That sacrifice is met with a great user experience in terms of stability, performance, legality, and better security.

The basic gist of it is, nobody wants to be censored or told what they can or can&#8217;t do.  However, anytime you take a large community and give them free reign with no rules (android devs), chaos always ensues.  That is true on so many levels of humanity, and holds true here.  I think that Android&#8217;s biggest problem is that they focus on whether or not they can, instead of whether or not they should.  Once Google realizes this, I will not be surprised to see how similar Android&#8217;s marketplace will be to Apple&#8217;s App Store.
